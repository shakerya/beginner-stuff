# My Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I develop skills in machine learning, with a focus on human-in-the-loop systems and rapid prototyping.

## Goals

* Achieve proficiency in [PyTorch/TensorFlow] within a year.
* Develop strong programming skills for clean, maintainable research code.
* Gain a deep understanding of building creative, human-centered AI systems.
* Learn to prototype solutions quickly and iterate based on product deadlines.
* Master effective technical communication, collaboration, and documentation.
